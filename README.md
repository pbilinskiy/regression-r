## Stages

0. Describe your variables.

    Perform EDA:

    - normality of variables
    - get sense of what kind of dependency is present (linear, exponential, polynomial)
    - detect potential outliers
    Describe what kind of dependency you expect.
    
    TODO

    - [x] ggplot2 - scatterplots and histograms.
    - [x] perform EDA

1. Check if correlation between y and x-s is present.

2. Fit linear regression

3. Provide confidence intervals for regressors and regressand under the assymptions of CRA.

4. Estimate the goodness of fit.

5. Check which of the assymptions of CRA don't hold.
(Maybe you should use Gauss Markov assymptions instead?)

6. Try to figure out the sourse of violation of CRA assymptions.
Transform variables so the assymptions are held.

7. Re-fit your model, find confidence intervals, estimate the goodness of fit.


Notations:
CRA - classical regressional analysis
